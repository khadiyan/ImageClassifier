Image Classifier
================

Image Classifier is a Python Project to classify images based on what those image contains dan move them to specified folder. Image Classifier using Google Tesseract Engine. Tesseract is an optical character recognition engine for various operating systems. It is free software, released under the Apache License, Version 5.0, and development has been sponsored by Google since 2006. In 2006 Tesseract was considered one of the most accurate open-source OCR engines then available.

I made this project due to lot of images in my WhatsApp Images directory, most of the images are images of campus activities advertisements etc., with a few lines of code I can sort out the important images more quickly.
